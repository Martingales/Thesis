\section{Outline}

The overarching topic of this thesis is the quantification and interpretation of transcriptional noise as measured by single-cell RNA sequencing. \textbf{Chapter 1} presents an initial experiment to study how  transcriptional noise effects the immune system. We see that transcriptional noise increases across multiple immune response genes during ageing which therefore could explain a disrupted immune response in older individuals. This finding has been published in following paper:\\

Odom; Ageing increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation; Science \emph{1436}; p. 1433-1436 ($^\ast$ equal contributions) \\

When studying changes in variability between two conditions, the analysis for this project was restricted to genes that did not change in mean expression due to a strong confounding between variability and mean expression. In \textbf{chapter 2}, I therefore extended the statistical framework that I used for the analysis to correct for this confounding effect. This correction lead to (i) a stabilization of model parameters, (ii) expansion of the gene set that can be tested for changes in variability and (iii) a novel way of interpreting transcriptional dynamics. This project has been published as:\\

The extended model offers the unique opportunity to study changes in variability across multiple cell types even when mean expression changes. In \textbf{chapter 3}, I apply the newly developed model to test changes in variability over pseudotime. This data has been generated to dissect the transcriptional dynamics during mouse spermatogenesis and has been submitted under: \\
