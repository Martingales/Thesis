\begin{Abstract}
Intrinsic stochasticity of biochemical reactions introduces phenotypic heterogeneity in seemingly homogeneous populations of cells. This phenomenon has been widely studied in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems while the functional role of phenotypic variation in development, health and disease is in the interest of ongoing research. Biological noise, a term to describe stochastic processes in cell populations, arises from different sources in homogeneous cell populations. Intrinsic noise summarizes the stochastic differences in transcription and translation of between individual genes and was classically measured in two-reporter systems(Elowitz et al., 2002; Raser and O’Shea, 2004). Promoter architecture, RNA polymerase II pausing, mRNA structure and translational events modulate intrinsic noise gene-specifically(Sanchez, Choubey and Kondev, 2013). Extrinsic noise arises due to cells being in different cellular states (e.g. cell cycle, cell-to-cell signalling and metabolism) within a homogeneous population(Zopf et al., 2013; Kiviet et al., 2014; Iwamoto, Shindo and Takahashi, 2016). While bursty transcription and translation introduce variations in mRNA and proteins abundance between cells, temporal averaging, nuclear retention(Battich, Stoeger and Pelkmans, 2015) and polyploidization(Bahar Halpern, Tanami, et al., 2015) are mechanisms to control for these variations. 
Recent technological advances allow the in depth analysis of biological noise in cell populations. Imaging methodologies(Moffitt, Hao, Wang, et al., 2016) and single-cell “omics” techniques(Bock, Farlik and Sheffield, 2016) permit the quantification of thousands of mRNA species, the genomic sequence, its epigenetic modification, and selected sets of proteins per cell. Moreover, the development of multi-omics technologies opens the possibility to link cell-to-cell variations between multiple regulatory layers across individual cells. With the emergence of single-cell omics technologies, new computational strategies to quantify noise were introduced(Brennecke et al., 2013; Aleksandra A. Kolodziejczyk et al., 2015; Buettner et al., 2015; Vallejos, Marioni and Richardson, 2015). 
Applying these high-throughput technologies to mammalian systems characterised the functional role of biological noise in healthy as well as diseased contexts. Early embryonic development is driven by continuous cell fate decision events while underlying decision rules are challenging to capture. Studies of recent years described changes in noise levels at different stages during embryonic development which hints at stochastic contributions to early mammalian development(Ohnishi et al., 2014; Goolam et al., 2016; Mohammed et al., 2017). Furthermore, the immune system displays intra- and inter-cell-type heterogeneity(Satija and Shalek, 2014). Phenotypic variation in immune cells, possibly derived by transcriptional noise, increases cellular plasticity and facilitates the population response to pathogens(Shalek et al., 2014b; Kellogg et al., 2015).
Conversely, increasing noise in cellular systems can also disrupt tissue function. Genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity within cell populations was described as driver for cancer development(Marusyk, Almendro and Polyak, 2012). The complete eradication of tumour cells is hindered by phenotypic variants that resist treatment(Spencer et al., 2009). Similarly, noise increases with age and has been shown to disrupt otherwise synchronized immune responses(Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2017) and is coupled with increased cellular stress(Enge et al., 2017).
In this Review, we introduce noise as an inherent feature of biological system before outlining recent developments of single-cell sequencing and imaging technologies. We comment on robust ways of quantifying biological noise and discuss positive and negative consequences of noise in cell populations. Finally, we give and overview on current challenges in experimental and computational approaches to measure, validate and perturb the role of noisy expression.

\section{What is loren ipsum? Title with math \texorpdfstring{$\sigma$}{[sigma]}} %Section - 1.1 

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry (see 
Section~\ref{section1.3}). Lorem Ipsum~\citep{Aup91} has been the industry's 
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of 
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem 
Ipsum~\citep{AAB95,Con90,LM65}.

The most famous equation in the world: $E^2 = (m_0c^2)^2 + (pc)^2$, which is 
known as the \textbf{energy-mass-momentum} relation as an in-line equation.

\section{Why do we use loren ipsum?} %Section - 1.2


It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using `Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for `lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

\section{Where does it come from?}  %Section - 1.3 
\label{section1.3}

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham

``Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."

Section 1.10.32 of ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC: ``Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?"

1914 translation by H. Rackham: ``But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of ``de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC: ``At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

1914 translation by H. Rackham: ``On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
