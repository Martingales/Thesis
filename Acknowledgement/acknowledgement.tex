First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor John Marioni for offering me to work in his research group. John took the risk in supervising me as a PhD student from a wet-lab background and introduced me to statistical analyses. I'm thankful for all his enthusiasm and support which guided me to successfully finishing my PhD. I also want to thank Catalina Vallejos for supervising me and turning me into a "Bayesian statistician". Not only did she support my work but also as a good friend. \\

This whole work builds on excellent collaborations. I want to thank Duncan Odom not only for allowing me to work with his lab but also for guiding me through important career-related processes (e.g.~paper writing). Christina Ernst supported large parts of this work with experiments, data interpretation and late nights of paper writing. I also want to thank Celia Martinez-Jimenez for large-scale experimental support. Furthermore, I thank Detlev Arendt and Kaia Achim for collaborating on an early project during my PhD. Maike de la Roche and Hung-Chang Chen played a crucial role for publishing the final version of the immune ageing project. My thesis advisory committee members, Sarah Teichmann, Wolfgang Huber and Duncan Odom provided fruitful discussions that advanced my research during over the last four years. \\

All current and former lab members of the Marioni lab deserve a huge thanks for providing such a pleasant and stimulating work environment. I specifically thank: Aaron Lun for his statistical support, entertainment and being a BK lunch companion; Michael Morgan for discussing what "noise" really means; Arianne Richard for biological insights into the confusing world of T cells. I also thank Anna, Chris, Luis, Antonio, Konrad, Catalina, Liora, Jonny, Tom, Ximena, Christina, and Rebecca for all the fun times during the last four years. \\

A special thanks also goes to people who read and commented on this thesis: Christina Ernst, Jack Monahan, Hannah Meyer, Michael Morgan, Catalina Vallejos, and John Marioni.
