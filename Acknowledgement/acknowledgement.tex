% **** Thesis Acknowledgements

\begin{acknowledgements}      


First and foremost, I want to thank my supervisor John Marioni for offering me to work in his research group. John took the risk in supervising me as a PhD student from a wet-lab background and introduced me to statistical analyses. I'm thankful for all his enthusiasm and support which guided me to successfully finishing my PhD. I also want to thank Catalina Vallejos for supervising me and turning me into a "Bayesian statistician". Not only did she support my work but also as a good friend. \\

This whole work builds on excellent collaborations. I want to thank Duncan Odom not only for allowing me to work with his lab but also for guiding me through important career-related processes (e.g.~paper writing). Christina Ernst supported large parts of this work with experiments, data interpretation and late nights of paper writing. I also want to thank Celia Martinez-Jimenez for experimental support.
