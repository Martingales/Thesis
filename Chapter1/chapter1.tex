\chapter{Ageing increases transcriptional noise during immune activation}  

\graphicspath{{Chapter1/Figures/}}

\begin{Abstract}
Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how ageing impacts transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA-sequencing of over a thousand unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4$^+$ T cells from young and old mice. In young animals, immunological activation drives a transcriptomic switch from highly variable to tightly regulated gene expression, characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. By profiling cells from two divergent mouse strains, we identified the conservation of this core set of immune response genes and the decrease in expression variability upon immune activation. Ageing significantly perturbed the activation of the core immune response program, and increased expression heterogeneity across different populations of CD4$^+$ T cells in both species. This discovery adds transcriptional noise as an unexplored hallmark of ageing to the list of phenotypic changes.
