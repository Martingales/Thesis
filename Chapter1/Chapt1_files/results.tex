Single cells were isolated from spleens of young (~3 month) and old (~21 month) individuals of two related mouse sub-species (Mus musculus domesticus, B6; Mus musculus castaneus, CAST). Isolated cells were subjected to single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) before or after 3 hours of in vitro activation using anti-CD3$\epsilon$/CD28 coated plates.}

To assess the conservation of immune activation programmes, we isolated CD4$^+$ T cells from healthy individuals of two inbred mouse sub-species separated by 1 million years of divergence: the reference C57BL/6J, Mus musculus domesticus (B6); CAST/EiJ, Mus musculus castaneus (CAST)). We characterized their gene expression programmes by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) during ageing in young (~3 months) and old (~21 months) individuals of each strain \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:chapt1_overview})}. These two sub-species have similar lifespans \citep{Yuan2011}, and CAST mice showed the hallmarks of normal organismal aging observed in B6 mice \citep{Rodwell2004}. All mice were healthy at the time of experiments. To asses different CD4$^+$ T cell compartments, we assayed cell populations with different levels of purity. First, we isolated all unstimulated CD4$^+$ T cells from spleen of old and young animals. Secondly, we highly purified naive CD4$^+$ T cells and effector memory (EM) CD4$^+$ T cells. For each species/condition, scRNA-seq experiments were performed using cells isolated from two individual mice.

\subsubsection*{Unstimualted CD4$^+$ T cells}

Unstimulated naive CD4$^+$ T cells were purified from dissociated mouse spleens using cell strainers, cell separation media and a MACS CD4$^+$ CD62L$^+$ T Cell Isolation Kit. Purified naive CD4$^+$ T cells were cultured in IMDM medium supplemented with 10\% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1 $\mu$g/mL Penicillin/Streptomicin, and 50 $\mu$M 2-mercaptoethanol. \\

Gating Strategy: lymphocytes were gated by the use of forward scatter (FSC-A) and side scatter (SSC-A). Cell doublets were excluded according to area and height of forward scatter (FSC-A/FSC-H). Dead cells were removed using viability dye. PD-1$^+$ CD4$^+$ T cells were excluded and PD-1-ve CD4$^+$ T cells were further separated into naive and EM CD4$^+$ T cell subsets according to their CD44 and CD62L expression. Cells with a mature CD24lo Qa2hi phenotype were then gated from naive and EM subsets and CD69+ cells were removed.}

Naive and effector memory CD4$^+$ T cells were purified from spleens of both young and old C57/BL6 mice by FACS.  Briefly, spleens were harvested from both young and old animals and single cell suspensions were obtained by meshing through a cell strainer (70 $\mu$m). B cells were depleted from cell suspensions by MACS using CD19 microbeads and red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer. The enriched cell fraction was then stained with Fixable eFluor 780 viability dye following by Fc receptor blocking with TruStain fcXTM and subsequent staining with a panel of fluorescence-conjugated antibodies against CD4, CD44, CD62L, CD24, Qa2, CD69 and PD-1.  Stained cells were immediately sorted using a 5-laser Aria IIu SORP instrument with the stringent gating strategy described in \textbf{Fig. \ref{fig1:FACS}}. \\
Hereafter, for simplification and clarity, purified unstimulated CD4$^+$ T cells will be named naive, stimulated cells will be named activated.

\subsubsection*{Activation of CD4$^+$ T cells}

Naive cells were seeded into 96-well plates coated for 1h at 37ºC with anti-CD3$\epsilon$ (1 $\mu$g/ml) and anti-CD28 (3 $\mu$g/ml) at a density of 80,000-120,000 cells/ml, and then cultured in a total volume of 100 $\mu$l media that did not contain cytokines or additional antibodies.

\subsubsection*{scRNAseq using the Fluidigm C1 system}

Naive, purified naive and activated CD4+ T cells were immediately collected and loaded on a 5–10$\mu$m Auto Prep Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) to capture single cells using the C1 Single cell Auto Prep System (Fluidigm). All IFCs were visually inspected, and wells with multiple cells or cell debris were marked as low quality. Upon cell capture, reverse transcription and cDNA amplification were performed using the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit and the Advantage 2 PCR Kit. ERCC spike-in RNA (1 $\mu$L diluted at 1:50,000) was added to the C1 lysis mix. All capture sites were included for the RNA-seq library preparation.

\subsubsection*{Read alignment to reference genomes}

Read alignment to reference genomes was performed using \emph{gsnap} with default parameters, while supplying splice-site positions. Samples taken from B6 were mapped against the mouse reference GRCm38. CAST samples were aligned against the \emph{Mus musculus castaneus de novo} genome assembly [ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1509-Assembly/], which was used under an advance access agreement [ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/REL-1509-Assembly/README]. Gene annotation for B6 was taken from the GRCm38 reference; gene annotation for CAST was taken from the newly constructed \emph{Mus musculus castaneus} assembly [http://hgwdev.cse.ucsc.edu/$\sim$ifiddes/mouse\_{}genomes\_{}data/, version 0.2]. Additionally, since mitochondrial genes and certain immune genes (e.g., CD28) are absent from the most recent \emph{Mus musculus castaneus} annotation, and since high mitochondrial gene expression is a well-established signature of low-quality single-cell transcriptome profiles \citep{Ilicic2016}, we also mapped CAST reads against GRCm38 and used the B6 annotation solely for these genes. Gene expression counts were obtained using HTSeq with default options. Only genes with orthologs in both species were considered for downstream analysis. 

\subsubsection*{Computational quality control and filtering}

We visually inspected the vast majority of cell-capture sites in each C1 small-integrated fluidic circuit using 40x magnification lensing to ensure precise capture of single cells \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:QC}A and B)}. Low-quality cells were computationally filtered using the following quality control criteria, developed by previous single-cell RNA-sequencing studies \citep{Brennecke2015, Buettner2015, Scialdone2015, Vallejos2015}:\\
The percentage of reads mapping to annotated genomic regions was compared to the percentage of reads mapping to ERCC spike-ins. Cells with low genomic read (< 20\%) and/or high ERCC read (> 50\%) numbers were excluded \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:QC}C)}. Additionally, cells with few mapped reads (< 1,000,000) or in which > 3000 or < 1250 genes were detected were removed \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:QC}D and E)}. Next, cells with more than 10\% or less than 0.5\% of mitochondrial reads were excluded \textbf{(\ref{fig1:QC}F)}. Further, known markers of lymphocytes were used to filter cells - CD19$^+$/H2-Aa$^+$ B cells as well as CD8+ T cells were removed \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:QC}H)}. Finally, in stimulated conditions, non-activated T cells were computationally removed \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig1:QC}I)}.

\subsubsection*{Characterization of isolated CD4$^+$ T cells}

In contrast to haematopoeitic cells \citep{Kowalczyk2015}, even when activated, virtually all CD4$^+$ T cells are in G1 phase of cell cycle as expected \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}A)}. Aged CD4$^+$ T cells showed no clonal expansions \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}B)} or difference in cell size \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}C)} that could impact analysis of gene expression variability \citep{Stubbington2015}. Using flow cytometry analysis, we confirmed that 96.4\% of the isolated CD4+ T cells were naive in young B6 \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}D)}. Naive CD4+ T cells formed a single, high-purity population in young animals. Old animals had a small population of CD4$^+$ T cells with slightly elevated CD44 levels, reduced CD62L expression, and attenuated activation dynamics \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}E-G)}. Upon T cell receptor (TCR) activation in the presence of particular cytokines, naive CD4$^+$ T cells can differentiate into several lineages of functionally different T helper cells (mainly Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, Tfh) \citep{Stubbington2015, Zhu2010}. In our data we do not detect any early differentiation in naive and activated CD4$^+$ T cell subsets. In accordance with the literature we found \textit{Gata3} but not Th2 cytokines expressed in the majority of cells  \citep{Ho2009}. Interestingly, the Th1-related genes \textit{Tbx21} and \textit{Ifng} were up-regulated, in an uncoordinated manner, in a small population of activated CD4$^+$ T cells of old animals. This is consistent with a known Th1 bias in CD4$^+$ T cell responses in old mice \citep{Zhang2014} and humans \citep{Sakata-Kaneko2000} \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}H)}. Furthermore, we did not detect any difference in TCR components/signaling and importantly detected no signs of T cell exhaustion \citep{Wherry2011}, especially in cells isolated from old animals \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}I)}. We also ruled out species-specific differences in commitment towards T helper cell lineages \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig:characterization}J-K)}. \\
