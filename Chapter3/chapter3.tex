\chapter{Transcriptional dynamics during spermatogenesis at single-cell resolution}  

\graphicspath{{Chapter3/Figures/}}

\begin{Abstract}
Understanding male fertility requires an in-depth characterisation of spermatogenesis, the developmental process by which male gametes are generated. Spermatogenesis occurs continuously throughout a maleâ€™s reproductive window and involves a complex sequence of developmental steps, both of which make this process difficult to decipher at the molecular level. To overcome this, we transcriptionally profiled single cells from multiple distinct stages during the first wave of spermatogenesis, where the most mature germ cell type is known. This naturally enriches for spermatogonia and somatic cell types present at very low frequencies in adult testes. Our atlas allowed us to reconstruct the three main processes of spermatogenesis: spermatogonial differentiation, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Additionally, we profiled the chromatin changes associated with meiotic silencing of the X chromosome, revealing a set of genes specifically and strongly repressed by H3K9me3 in the spermatocyte stage, but which escape post-meiotic silencing in spermatids.

\begin{Comment}
\textbf{Declaration} This project has been a collaboration including members of the Marioni and Odom lab. Christina Ernst performed all experiments presented in this chapter and performed preliminary analysis for the Cut\&Run data. Celia P. Martinez-Jimenez performed preliminary experiments. John Marioni and Duncan Odom supervised the study. Christina Ernst, I, John Marioni and Duncan Odom designed the study and wrote the manuscript. I performed all computational analysis and produced all figures in this chapter (except the histology images and schematics).
