\begin{Abstract}
Spermatogenesis is a recurring differentiation process that results in the production of male gametes within the testes and its in-depth characterisation is needed to understand male fertility. During spermatogenesis, spermatogonial stem cells undergo a unidirectional differentiation process to form spermatocytes, round spermatids and lastly mature sperm. This process involves a complex sequence of developmental steps and is coupled to large-scale chromatin rearrangements, therefore making it difficult to profile.
In the first instance, we thoroughly characterised spermatogenesis by   profiling transcriptomes of over 20,000 cells which were captured using droplet-based scRNA-Seq. To confidently connect transcriptional profiles to distinct developmental stages, we profiled multiple time-points during the first wave of spermatogenesis. As juvenile animals progress through spermatogenesis for the first time, development has only progressed to a certain point, thus allowing the identification of the most mature cell type. With this exact labelling, we can dissect developmental processes such as spermatogonial differentiation, meiosis and spermiogenesis on a molecular level. Furthermore, our data captured the expression dynamics of the X chromosome, which is subject to meiotic silencing in spermatocytes, followed by a partial reactivation in spermatids, revealing distinct temporal expression dynamics regarding the reactivation of the X chromosome post-meiosis. Profiling of the associated chromatin changes identified a set of genes specifically repressed by H3K9me3 in spermatocytes that later-on escape post-meiotic silencing in spermatids, demonstrating extensive chromatin remodelling on the X chromosome. After fully characterising spermatogenesis on a single-cell level, changes in transcriptional variability can be detected by estimating residual over-dispersion measures for the different germ cell populations using BASiCS. In this analysis, the differentiation trajectory defines a new confounding factor effecting the variability measures.
