\section{Droplet based single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse testis}
\subsection*{High-resolution profiling by single-cell RNA-seq captures the unidirectional differentiation of germ cells during adult spermatogenesis}

Spermatogenesis is a recurrent differentiation process that produces male gametes within testicular seminiferous tubules \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_staging}A)}. The seminiferous epithelium in the mouse is classified into twelve distinct stages, based on the combination of cell types present \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_staging}B)}. Tubules cycle asynchronously and continuously through these stages and adult testis contain tubules in every possible epithelial stage \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_staging}}. \\

The colour gradient within the circle indicates the differentiation path of germ cells with the layers corresponding to individual cycles of the epithelium. The circle is divided into 12 section, each corresponding to one epithelial stage displaying the characteristic germ cells. Within each section, cells are positioned across the different layers according to their emergence during consecutive cycles, each being 8.6 days apart with more mature cells moving towards the centre.  Cell types are labelled as: A – type A spermatogonia (SG), In – intermediate SG, B – type B SG, Pl – preleptotene spermatocytes (SCs), L – leptotene SCs, Z – zygotene SCs, P – pachytene SCs, D – diplotene SCs, M – metaphase I and II, 1-8 round spermatids, 9-16 elongating spermatids. \textbf{(C)} Higher magnification of two tubules depicted in (A). The PAS-stained cross-sections depict tubules in Stage VII and Stage X, with the different cell layers indicated by coloured lines. Stage VII tubules contain 4 different layers with germ cells from different generations that are approximately 8.6 days apart, whereas Stage X tubules only contain three layers. Each layer contains a certain set of germ cells depending on the epithelial stage. Stage VII contains preleptotene spermatocytes (Pl) in the first layer, pachytene spermatocytes (P) in the second layer, S7 round spermatids (7) in the third layer and S16 elongating spermatids in the fourth innermost layer. Stage X tubules contain leptotene spermatocytes (L) in the first layer, pachytene spermatocytes (P) in the the second layer and only one generation of round-to-elongating spermatids at S10 (10) in the innermost layer. Original magnification 400X.  \\}

To fully dissect mouse spermatogenesis, we primarily analysed droplet based single-cell RNA sequencing using the 10X Chromium technology \citep{Zheng2017}. For this, mouse testes were enzymatically dissociated and single-cell suspensions at a concentration of ~300,000 cells/ml was loaded into one channel of the ChromiumTM Single Cell A Chip (10X Genomics), aiming for a recovery of 4000-5000 high-quality cells. Cells were isolated from specifically staged juvenile (between postnatal days 6 and 35) and adult (8-9 weeks) C57BL/6J (B6) mice \textbf{(Table \ref{tab3:QC_scRNAseq})}. To obtain gene-specific transcript counts for droplet based scRNA-Seq, the Cell Ranger \emph{count} function with default settings was used to align and count unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per sample. This software retains cells with similar UMI distributions \citep{Zheng2017} which we label as "high-quality" transcriptomes. We use this default threshold to obtain high-quality cells with large numbers of UMIs. After merging all samples, we filtered out cells that express less than 1000 genes. Furthermore, we exclude cells with more than 10\% of reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome. \\
Using the Cell Ranger default threshold leads to the exclusion of cells with lower transcriptional complexity. We therefore used the emptyDrops function provided in the \emph{DropletUtils} Bioconductor package \citep{Lun2018} to statistically distinguish empty droplets from genuine cells (controlling the FDR to 1\%). After merging true cells across all samples, we filtered out cells with less than 500 genes expressed. Furthermore, we excluded cells with more than 10\% or mitochondrial genes expressed \textbf{(Table \ref{tab3:QC_scRNAseq})}. The transcriptomes of quality filtered cells were normalized using the scran package \citep{Lun2016pooling}. After quality control and filtering, we retained more than 20,000 high-quality single cells and over 46,000 cells including the once with lower transcriptional complexity \textbf{(Table \ref{tab3:QC_scRNAseq})}. \\
This two-way approach allows us to (i) dissect molecular processes using high-quality cells and capture all testicular cell types, even cells with low transcriptional complexity.\\

Additionally, for juvenile samples, we generated whole-tissue bulk RNA sequencing, as well as mapping chromatin state in purified cell populations using CUT\&{}RUN (Cleavage Under Targets \& Release Using Nuclease) \citep{Skene2018}. With this, we additionally generated 30 bulk RNA-Seq libraries and 8 CUT\&{}RUN libraries.The full experimental set-up can be seen in \textbf{Fig.~\ref{fig3:experimental_design}}.

To remove batch-specific effects that arise when samples are prepared and sequenced in different experiments \textbf{(Tables \ref{tab3:QC_scRNAseq})}, we used the \emph{mnnCorrect} function implemented in the \emph{scran} package \citep{Haghverdi2018}. We used the top 1000 genes with highest biological variation across all samples as informative genes for batch correction. The \emph{mnnCorrect} function takes transcriptional profiles of cells isolated from adult B6 mice as first input and uses this dataset as reference for cell mapping. This approach maps the juvenile samples onto the adult B6 \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_types}A)}

To identify cell types across all samples, batch corrected transcriptomes were clustered using a graph-based approach. A shared nearest-neighbour (SNN) graph \citep{Xu2015} was constructed considering 3 shared nearest neighbours using the \emph{buildSNNGraph} function in scran. In the next step, a multi-level modularity optimization algorithm was used to find community structure in the graph \citep{Blondel2008} implemented in \emph{igraph} R package. Cells in small clusters that show unclear identities were excluded from down-stream analysis.\\
We next aimed to annotate clusters based on the expression of marker genes. The adult B6 samples were used to identify marker genes for all germ cell-types present in testes. To this end, we performed differential expression testing across multiple pairwise comparisons. To detect cluster-specific marker genes, the \emph{findMarkers} function implemented in \emph{scran} was used on the log$_2$-transformed normalized counts while providing the cluster labels \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_types}B)}. \\

On a broad level and by visualizing the expression of detected marker genes, we identified the following cell types: spermatogonia (based on \textit{Dmrt1} expression, \citep{Matson2010}), spermatocytes (\textit{Piwil1}, \citep{Deng2002}), round and elongating spermatids (\textit{Tex21} and \textit{Tnp1}, respectively, \citep{Fujii2002}), as well as the main somatic cell types of the testis, Sertoli (\textit{Cldn11}, \citep{Mazaud-Guittot2010}) and Leydig cells (\textit{Fabp3}, \citep{Oresti2013}) \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_types}B)}. Using a dimensionality reduction technique for visualization (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding; \textbf{Fig.~\ref{fig3:cell_types}C}), the germ cell types from spermatocytes to elongating spermatids formed a continuum, which recapitulated the known developmental trajectory.

\section{Developmental staging of mouse spermatogenesis}
\subsection*{Staged developmental mapping of the first wave of spermatogenesis defines germ cell identity}

Historically, sub-staging of the major cell types within the testis was based on changes in nuclear or cellular morphology \citep{Oakberg1956,  Oakberg1956a}. Previous attempts to complement morphology with molecular signatures have been limited to FACS-based and sedimentation assays, where the resolution was unable to differentiate between sub-cell-types \citep{Bastos2005, Gaysinskaya2014, Lam1970, Meistrich1977, Romrell1976, Soumillon2013}. While a mixture of all spermatogenic cell types co-exists in the adult, the first wave of spermatogenesis during juvenile development is more synchronised. Starting around mouse postnatal day P4, spermatogonia begin to differentiate, forming the first generation of spermatocytes as early as P10, round spermatids by P20, and completing the first wave of spermatogenesis with the production of mature spermatozoa between P30 and P35 \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}A)} \citep{Bellve1977, Janca1986, Nebel1961}.\\
 
We exploited this first spermatogenic wave to generate thousands of high-resolution single-cell transcriptional profiles of morphologically well-defined cell populations. For this, we sampled multiple time points during the first wave to identify the most mature (differentiated) cell types. Based on known sperm developmental transitions, we chose six time points between P10 and P35 from which to generate single-cell RNA-Seq libraries \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}A)}. For each juvenile experiment, we found that the population of developing germ cells was strongly enriched at the expected developmental stage, as quantified by the percentage of cells in each cell-type cluster \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}B and C)}. By associating these cell types with the corresponding cell types in the adult trajectory, we unambiguously assigned molecular and histological signatures to cells during adult spermatogenesis.\\

For instance, at P15 the majority of cells are spermatogonia and spermatocytes progressing through the mid-pachytene stage, in accord with the appearance of the sex body \citep{Turner2004}. Interestingly, less mature cell types are also present at this time point (and later time points), supporting recent reports that the first wave of spermatogenesis is less synchronized than previously anticipated \citep{Snyder2010}. At P20, we detect an enrichment for spermatocytes, cells undergoing meiotic cell division, and a small group of early round spermatids. This population structure is in line with matched histology, which shows a large number of tubules in late stages IX-XII and the first occurrence of early round spermatids \citep{Bellve1977}.\\
Spermatids first reach the elongating state between P24 and P26 \citep{Janca1986}. At P25, we observed cells matched to our first ten clusters of spermatids, which we then labelled according to morphologically-defined spermatid substages S1 – S10 \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}C)}. At P30 and P35, we observed a relatively even distribution of cells across all groups, closely resembling the adult distribution up to S14, indicating that the first wave of spermatogenesis is complete.

The colour gradient indicates the probability with which a bulk sample can be assigned to the specific cell cluster.  \\}
\captionsetup[figure]{list=yes}

To further validate the identity of the cell clusters, we used bulk RNA-Seq from testis collected during the first wave of spermatogenesis every two days between P6 and P34 \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}A)}. We used a regression approach to link the bulk samples to the transcriptomic profiles of single cells. Using the top 50 cluster-specific marker genes for spermatogonia, all spermatocyte groups, all spermatid groups, sertoli and leydig cells, we trained a random forest classifier (implemented in the \emph{randomForest} R package \citep{Liaw2002}) on 2000 cells isolated from adult B6 testes. Model testing was performed on the remaining 1215 cells isolated from adult B6 testes. Prior to training and testing, log$_2$-transformed, normalized counts were scaled by computing the Z score for each gene. Probabilistic prediction was performed using the Z score of log$_2$-transformed, normalized bulk RNA-Seq reads of the input genes. This confirmed that between P6 – P14 spermatogonia and somatic cells show the highest contribution to the transcriptomic profile \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:1st_wave}D)}. Between P16 and P20 we observed the emergence of spermatocyte-specific gene expression signatures, after which spermatids become the transcriptionally dominant cell type. By P26, spermatids reach the elongating state where transcription is uniformly shut-down due to the beginning of the histone-to-protamine transition \citep{Steger1999}; following this, changes in RNA content are mostly due to degradation. Bulk transcriptional profiles can therefore only be classified up to S10, because transcription is largely inactive thereafter.\\

In sum, by combining transcriptional and histological analyses at specific stages during the first wave of spermatogenesis, we assigned transcriptional profiles to specific, morphologically defined germ cell types.

\section{Under-represented cell types in spermatogenesis}
\subsection*{Identification of under-represented and transcriptionally silent cell types in adolescent testes}

In addition to assigning the dominant cell types in germ cell development, we further exploited the juvenile samples to analyse the highly enriched cell types that are rare in adult testes, including somatic support cells, spermatogonia and the earliest spermatocytes.  Through the first wave of spermatogenesis, the ratio between germ cells and somatic cells increases; therefore, to study heterogeneity within the somatic cell population, we focused on the P10 stage, where somatic cells are relatively more frequent. As expected, we readily identified substantial numbers of Sertoli and Leydig cells, which are the main somatic cell types in adult \citep{Griswold1998, Haider2004}.  In addition, we newly identified a large population of immature Leydig cells, based on \textit{Dlk1} expression \citep{Lottrup2014}. Furthermore, we detected the cells that form the basal lamina such as peritubular myoid cells (PTM, \textit{Acta2}, \citep{Cool2008}), vascular endothelial cells (\textit{Tm4sf1}, \citep{Shih2009}), and testicular macrophages (\textit{Cd14}, \citep{Kitchens2000}) \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:somatic_cells}A and B)}. By performing differential expression analysis, we identified novel markers for these cell populations that are relatively under-represented in adult testes.\\

\label{fig3:somatic_cells}
\end{figure}

Identifying spermatogonial sub-populations in adult testes is greatly complicated by their rarity relative to other germ cell types \citep{Lukassen2018}. However, during early juvenile development spermatogonia are relatively enriched, which we exploited to further characterize their heterogeneity \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig3:somatic_cells}A)}. By combining cells from P10 and P15, we obtained 1,186 transcriptional profiles that capture sub-populations during spermatogonial differentiation \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig3:somatic_cells}B)}. To analyse transcriptomes of P10 and P15 samples, we performed batch correction between these samples as described above. We detected two clusters corresponding to undifferentiated spermatogonia (A$_\textnormal{undiff}$) based on their expression of \textit{Nanos3} and \textit{Zbtb16} \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig3:somatic_cells}B and C)} \citep{Buaas2004, Lolicato2008}). These cells comprise A$_\textnormal{s}$, A$_\textnormal{paired}$, and A$_\textnormal{aligned}$ spermatogonia that decrease in stemness as they divide and gain competency to differentiate \citep{Suzuki2012}. Additionally, these cells express a number of marker genes also detected in undifferentiated human spermatogonial stem cells, such as \textit{Gfra1}, \textit{Bcl6} and \textit{Id4} \citep{Guo2017}. Based on the expression of \textit{Stra8} (Stimulated by retinoic acid 8), we can map the point at which spermatogonial differentiation is induced (A$_\textnormal{aligned}$-to-A$_\textnormal{1}$ transition), thus marking the beginning of differentiating spermatogonia (A$_\textnormal{diff}$) \citep{Endo2015}. A$_\textnormal{diff}$ are marked by the expression of \textit{Sohlh1} \citep{Ballow2006} and are highly proliferative, generating A$_\textnormal{1-4}$, Intermediate and B spermatogonia. Late differentiating spermatocytes express \textit{Dmrtb1} (also referred to as \textit{Dmrt6}), which mediates the mitosis-to-meiosis transition and quickly disappears in preleptotene spermatocytes. This latter population shows a second increase in Stra8 expression levels, which is necessary for initiation of meiosis \textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig3:somatic_cells}B and C)} \citep{Anderson2008, Endo2015, Zhang2014}.

\end{figure}

The transition between differentiating spermatogonia and spermatocytes is a gradual process that occurs in stage VIII tubules when B spermatogonia divide and form preleptotene spermatocytes \citep{Anderson2008, Baltus2006}. We were therefore surprised not to observe a continuous differentiation trajectory bridging spermatogonia to spermatocytes textbf{(Fig. \ref{fig3:somatic_cells}C)}. One possible explanation is that leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes have decreased transcriptional activity \citep{Kierszenbaum1974, Monesi1965}, and are thus likely to be classified as empty droplets by the 10X CellRanger pipeline. 
To capture these transcriptionally quiescent cells, we applied a newly developed computational method that distinguishes between droplets capturing genuine cells containing small amounts of mRNA versus empty droplets containing only ambient mRNA \citep{Lun2018}. Applying this approach increased the number of early spermatocytes in all samples and, in particular, identified a population of cells connecting spermatogonia and spermatocytes at the predicted position in the cell trajectory \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:emptyDrops}A-C)}. As expected for leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes, these cells show high mRNA levels for genes involved in synaptonemal complex formation, chromosome synapsis and DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation such as \textit{Sycp1}, \textit{H2afx} and \textit{Hormad1} \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:emptyDrops}D)} \citep{Daniel2011, Mahadevaiah2001, Vries2005}.\\
In addition to early spermatocytes, droplets with lower transcriptional complexity also captured late condensing spermatids; as mentioned above, these late stages of spermiogenesis are characterized by continuous degradation of RNA after transcriptional shutdown at the round-to-elongating transition \citep{Steger1999} \textbf{(Fig.~\ref{fig3:emptyDrops}E)}.\\
 
By profiling carefully chosen developmental time points and applying new methods to incorporate single cells with lower transcriptional complexity, our results elucidate a more complete view of testicular cell type composition that includes previously under-represented cell types.
